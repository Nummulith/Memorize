  - Name: GuardDuty findings generate a ticket in a third-party system through email
    Note: |
      Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that includes an event pattern that matches Medium/High severity GuardDuty findings. Set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Configure the third-party ticketing email system as a subscriber to the SNS topic. Set the SNS topic as the target for the EventBridge rule

  - Name: s3 object logs in CloudTrail
    Note: |
      CloudTrail by default logs S3 bucket-level API calls but does not include logs for object-level requests.
      To monitor object-level actions such as PutObjectAcl, you must enable data events for your S3 bucket or account-wide, which allows CloudTrail to log these specific events.

  - Name: CloudWatch Events vs EventBridge
    Note: |
      AWS suggests using Amazon EventBridge to manage your events.
      CloudWatch Events and EventBridge are the same underlying service and API, but EventBridge provides more features.

  - Name: Detects public S3 object, set the alarm to notificate and remediate
    Note: |
      Enable object-level CloudTrail logging for S3
      configure an EventBridge event-pattern based rule to analyze the CloudTrail logs
      The target for this rule can be set as an SNS topic.
      The SNS would send the notification
      Moreover, the SNS topic is also subscribed by Lambda run to secure the objects
